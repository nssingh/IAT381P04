						<p class="subtitle">What is FROSH</p>
						
						<p class="stuff">Beedie FROSH is a two weekend introduction to the Beedie School of Business. FROSH allows first-year business students to forge lasting relationships with faculty, professors, senior students and other first-year students with the goal of easing the transition from high school to university. 
						FROSH is the BEST event of the year that unites people from across the Business Faculty!  Beedie FROSH hosts over 250+ students and runs on a 
						budget of $30,000 generated on ticket sales and sponsorship generated by students.</p>
					    
						<p class="subtitle">Logo</p>
						
						
						<div><img src="froshLogoCCbig.png" alt="froshlogo" height="200" width="100"></div>
						<p class="stuff">As Beedie FROSH Chair, I wanted to create a new brand and culture for the event that would continue through future years.
						I wanted FROSH to have a consistent identity and a culture that would enrich the lives of first years and give them a chance to
						make new connections and have a strong and warm welcome to their university career.  </p>
						
						<p class="stuff">The logo consists of a "B" with the negative space forming a "F".  Underneath that the name "Beedie FROSH" exists.
						The shape formed for the logo resembles a path, representing a students career through university, with many turns, but that they would
						always remember that their career began with FROSH. </p>
						
						<p class="subtitle">Website</p>
						
						
						<div class="froshweb"><img src="froshhomepage.png" alt="froshsite" height="800" width="550"></div>

						<p class="stuff">The goal for the website was to make FROSHees (first years attending the event), to have a  reason to come to the site and interact with it.
						We kept the itinerary a mystery to help build excitement, while using social media(Twitter, Facebook and Youtube) to engage students and sponsors.  The website held
						all the information for the event, profiles for all the mentors and organizing committee, and had updated information for the rankings of teams during the event.  It was also the
						main area for registration, as we had an online registration for the first time.</p>
						
						<div id="froshlink"> <a href="http://beediefrosh.ca/frosh2012/">Click here to visit the Beedie FROSH 11 Website</a> </div>

						<p class="subtitle">Legacy</p>
						
						<p class="stuff">The logo has been used for the past two consecutive years, as well as the website content, put into different wordpress themes.  The culture that my organizing committee and I
						worked to create has been continued on through my guidance and through the FROSHees and mentors who have continued on with the event.</p>
