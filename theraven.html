						<p id="subtitle">Synopsis</p>
						
						<p class="stuff">John is married to his beautiful wife Lenore.  They have a happy relationship until John cheats on Lenore with the mysterious Raven.  This results with Lenore taking her life.  John is haunted by what he has done to Lenore, but this does not stop his relationship with the Raven.  He begins to lose his mind, being haunted by the memory of the late Lenore.</p>
					    
					    <p id="subtitle">My Role</p>

					    <p class="stuff">I was tasked with creating a short narrative, creating the script, hiring professional actors, filming and producing a short film.  I had 4 months to develop a story and create the end result.  Unfortunately, due to a harddrive failure,
					    I no longer have my story boards or mood boards.</p>
						<p class="stuff">Group Project (2 people)</p>
						<p class="stuff">Tasks: Director, Editor, Screenwriter</p>
						<p class="stuff">Tools: DSLR, Light Kit, Audio Equipment, Final Cut X, Adobe Audition</p>
						
						<div id="contactlink"> <a href="http://iat344theraven.blogspot.ca/">Click here to read and see the in depth process of creating this short film on one of my blogs</a> </div>

					    <p id="subtitle">Outcome</p>
					     <p class="stuff">We received an A+ on the video and were praised for our unique vision for the narrative.  The professor and teaching assistants, as well as the audience
					     were on edge by the dark narrative and felt that the narration was a strong touch to push the visuals.  The acting was commended as well as the editing and sound design.</p>

					     <p class="stuff">Able to take something that is well known by the general public and create a new take on that image and story.  Able to film and edit videos at a high quality
					     that is engaging to an audience.</p>
